function convert_tsv2mat(tsv_file,TR)
%% This function takes a tsv file and converts it to an onset file suitable for SPM FFX analysis
% The scripts extracts the conditions' names, onsets, and durations (in seconds) from the tsv file,
% and converts them to TRs (time unit) by DIVIDING the onsets/durations by the TR.
% The ONSET MAT file is saved to be used by SPM for the FFX analysis
%%

% Read the tsv file

    names_tmp(iCond,1)= cellstr(conds(iCond,:));   % Get the name of the condition
